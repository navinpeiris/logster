### Breaking Changes

- Any metadata that needs to be logged needs to now be setup in the `Logger` backend configuration. This is so that metadata configuration is centralised and so that there is no duplication of metadata in the logged output. See [Issue#17](https://github.com/navinpeiris/logster/issues/17) for more details.
